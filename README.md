# CoarseGrained-VortexShedding

This repository features code and datasets for analyzing a coarse-grained cylinder vortex shedding dataset. This work is discussed in Williams et al. (_in progress_) and features the code used to perform coarse-grained analyses. The work makes extensive use of the SINDy method introduced in Brunton et al. (2016a) and PDE-FIND introduced in Rudy et al. (2017).



# Vortex Shedding

Vortex shedding is an important and striking physical phenomenon observed in fluids charaterized by alternating, periodic vortices behind a body in a freestream with sufficient Reynolds number Re.
