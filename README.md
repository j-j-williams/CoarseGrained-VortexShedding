# CoarseGrained-VortexShedding

### To-Do
1. Update the `stem` string variables and related variables, in `Processing` codes and `Main` codes, in order to reflect the new directories of the data.
2. Upload some IBPM simulation files (maybe just Re=50 and only ibpm20000.bin).
3. Upload code for iterating across PDE-FIND sparsity.
